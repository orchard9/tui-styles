description: Plan a new milestone with phases and tasks using evolutionary design
---

I need to create a new milestone. Use the tui-styles-planner agent to:

1. Define milestone goals and success criteria
2. Break down into phases (quick-wins, core-features, polish)
3. Create task structure with dependencies
4. Generate markdown files in roadmap/milestone-N/

**Technical Note**: This command uses `tui-styles-cli milestone create` to create milestones and `tui-styles-cli task create` to generate task files with proper templates.

Start by asking me: What feature or goal is this milestone for?
